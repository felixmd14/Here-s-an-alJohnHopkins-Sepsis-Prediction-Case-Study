# Sepsis Prediction: A Case Study on John Hopkins Data

## Introduction

In the healthcare industry, the early detection and management of critical medical conditions can significantly impact patient outcomes and improve the quality of care. One such life-threatening condition is sepsis, which is the body's extreme response to an infection. Sepsis occurs when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout the body. Prompt identification and intervention in cases of sepsis are pivotal in preventing its progression and reducing mortality rates.

This analysis embarks on the exploration of a dataset containing essential medical and demographic information of patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The primary objective is to leverage this dataset to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify individuals at risk of developing sepsis during their ICU stay. By doing so, healthcare professionals can receive early warnings, allowing them to initiate timely interventions and potentially save lives.

## Questions

The analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. What is the distribution of Sepsis?
2. What is the distribution of Age?
3. How Many Patients have Insurance?
4. Is Blood Pressure Affected by Age?
5. How many patients in each BMI category have sepsis?
6. How many of the patients fall under the Normal, Elevated, and High Blood Pressure categories?

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant relationship between a patient's age and the likelihood of developing sepsis.

- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The age of a patient is a significant factor that influences the likelihood of developing sepsis.

### Hypothesis 2

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the distribution of blood pressure (PR) values between patients who develop sepsis (Sepsis: Positive) and those who do not (Sepsis: Negative).

- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the distribution of blood pressure (PR) values between patients who develop sepsis (Sepsis: Positive) and those who do not (Sepsis: Negative).
